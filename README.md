     The keyboard has 6.5 mm holes on the bottom plate. 

This is a prototype for adjustable height tenting legs for the keyboard.
The part was printed in carbon fiber ABS, with a M3 brass inset to seat an M3 (6 mm length) tension screw.
The rod is 10 mm aluminum but could be stainless, brass, carbon fiber, delrin, etc.
The leg screws to the keyboard with an M6 (8 mm length) screw. 
Affixed to the bottom of the leg is a 10 mm adhesive rubber bumper.

The leg could be made in different lengths of plastic and/or rod to create the heights and angles desired.
